## Description
This dataset is used to control and monitor the performance of NG-RAN modules. Each cell contains a complex IQ sample for a Resource Element (RE), as used in real-time transmission. This dataset corresponds to the time-frequency resource map in the RAN fronthaul U-Plane for a 100 MHz 5G NR signal using 30 kHz SCS:
